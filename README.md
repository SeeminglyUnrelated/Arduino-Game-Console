# Arduino Game Console
 A small game console for arduino + LED Matrices and joystick\
 Uses LedConrol library

 I have tried to make this as flexible as possible, more updates coming soon

# How to use
 If you want to trie this for yourself, you can connect the display, joysticks and buttons wherever you want and toggle some variables in gameEngine.h  
 Then, you can try some of the preinstalled games or make your own. As of writing, the game engine is very basic and doesn't support image buffers yet, so your eyes may hurt a bit.

# Further developement
 Game engine is still being developed, upcoming features:
 - Image Buffer  
 - Image draw function that runs smoothly and effeciently

# What will *not* be added
 - Collision since because of limited memory

#### As of version 0.0.2
